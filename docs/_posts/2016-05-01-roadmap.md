I am very excited about augmenting stord.io with lightweight features that will align with the project's minimalist philosophy. Here are some ideas I'm working on:

 - https (this must happen before beta, as api keys are currently sent in the clear)
 - Searching of keys and values
 - Bulk download/upload (giving us backup and restore)

Am I missing a killer feature? Email me at <contact@stord.io>, and I'll probably put it in!

Check for updates on the [blog](http://blog.stord.io), or on the github [wiki](https://github.com/0atman/stord.io/wiki).
