I am very excited about augmenting stord.io with lightweight features that will align with the project's minimalist philosophy. Here are some ideas I'm working on:

 - Https (this must happen before beta, as api keys are currently sent in the clear)
 - Searching of keys and values
 - Bulk download/upload (giving us backup and restore)

Am I missing a killer feature? Email me at <contact@stord.io>!

When the alpha test comes to and end I'll relaunch stord.io in beta, and switch to a freemium model. I will engage the alpha testers to see what the right figures should be, but it will most likely be something around the $1/month and $10/year range, with a discount for alpha users.
