We are very excited about augmenting stord.io with lightweight features that will align with our minimalist philosophy. Here are some ideas we're working on:

 - Https (this must happen before beta, as api keys are currently sent in the clear)
 - Searching of keys and values
 - Bulk download/upload (giving us backup and restore)

Are we missing a killer feature? Email us at contact@stord.io!

When the alpha test comes to and end we'll relaunch stord.io in beta, and switch to a freemium model. We will engage our alpha testers to see what the right figures should be, but it will most likely be something around the $1/month and $10/year range, with a discount for alpha users.
