To paraphrase [Aaron Swartz](http://webpy.org/philosophy):

_**Think about the ideal way to store data in a web app. Write the code to make it happen.**_

To get going, simply enter your email to get an api key and start hacking! (no lengthy registration required, your api key IS your account) During alpha, there's no limit on the amount of data you can store (within reason).
