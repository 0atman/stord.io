Stord.io is a key/value store. This is often modelled as a hashmap or a dictionary in programming languages.

Represented in javascript, it looks like this:


{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
{
  "name": "stord.io"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Any string data can be stord. If you need to namespace your data, the redis community have the answer, prepend your keys with your namespace (eg, `mynamespace:mykey`). Stord.io doesn't assume anything about your data, make whatever nested schema you want!

Under the hood, stord.io is powered by the proven and scalable Redis database, with a thin python application wrapper, based on Flask. Redis is fast. Like, REALLY fast.

To get going, simply enter your email to get an api key and get cracking! (no lengthy registration required, your api key IS your account)During alpha, there's no limit on the amount of data you can store (within reason).
