Stord.io is a key/value store. This is often modelled as a hashmap or a dictionary in programming languages.

Represented in javascript, a response from `/key/name` could look like this:


{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
{
  "name": "stord.io"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Under the hood, stord.io is powered by the proven and scalable Redis database, with a thin python application wrapper, based on Flask. Redis is fast. Like, REALLY fast.

Any string data can be stord. If you need to namespace your data, the redis community have the answer, prepend your keys with your namespace (eg, `mynamespace:mykey`). Stord.io doesn't assume anything about your data, make whatever nested schema you want!
